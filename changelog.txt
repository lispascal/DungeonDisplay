v0.6.4 (7/6/2012 19:33) CURRENT RELEASE
    -Added in the option of choosing your resolution in pixels per square
        Currently with 2 pixel margin marking inbetween squares; this may be adjustable later
        -using the load/create new worked fine with different resolutions
            -too low will cause problems; board has to fill up the window vertically at least
        

        -However, re-sizing it via misc. menu is buggy; it cuts off the bottom of square
            -workaround: Set square size to a lower value (20 pix) then your value
            -note: errors were found around 30pix range, along with horizontal shifting at most ranges


v0.6.3 (7/1/2012 1:38)
    -quick patch, fixed players and mob panes so they can be scrolled.


v0.6.2 (6/21/2012 1:50)

Changed "Hide Square" (see below)
Hide Square no longer effect - in Misc menu, there is "Hide Room" option.
Every "Hide Square" placed will be given a room number
    Hide Room acts just like placing terrain; it gives a number with a box (for readability)
    when all rooms are hidden, clicking on a hidden room will unhide all squares of that room number.
        when they are not, it will act normally (painting the grid).



v0.6 (6/20/2012 04:25)
Features:
    added Hide Square effect (filled gray); it hides most of the tooltip of a square
    and is painted on top of everything else when on a square; effect is that
    the square's contents are hidden until the effect has been negated via red x.
        -to be used by DM for hiding rooms, chests/traps, etc.
        Possible bug for old map saves: pre-v0.6 map files containing effects will have the wrong effects
            -any other files should be fine.

    redone import of player and mob pictures and file import;
        -config and list files in bestiary, players, and maps folders obsolete.
            these files will be deleted if they exist, for the next version or so, to clean up folders
        -due to the above, you can now add player images, mob images, and maps
            directly to their respective folders in %appdata%\DungeonDisplay,
            and the game will notice them upon re-launch
        

    redone file load menu
        additionally, "delete" and "rename" file buttons are in the load dialog AND functional
        -double clicking a filename will now open it;
        -selecting a file then hitting "delete" is the same as hitting the delete button
        -same as above with rename and F2 (supposedly; this is unverified)
        

    resizable (and maximizable) window support
        - menu stays at 200px * height
        - map fills in rest of window

    -map save/load problems fixed.
        -added backward compatible code for 0.5 maps
        -maps no longer should invert their dimensions upon save and load.


v0.5.4 (not an actual release)
    IS DOLAN
    map load/save problems fixed (almost)

v0.5.3 Release (6/18/2012 21:05)
    fixed load dialog staying open after successful load. Now it closes.
        EDIT: ACTUALLY NOT


v0.5.2 Release (6/18/2012 21:05)
    fixed save/load?

v0.5 Release (6/18/2012 19:34)

Features:

    SAVING AND LOADING WORKS
        Can now load from initial file dialog (instead of new file)
        Saving has its own tab in the window; it may take a while when with huge maps (>200x>200)
    
    if a terrain, effect, or object is selected, there now displays
            an image overlay showing so ("ants" around the edges")

    Updates the player and mob groups when new ones are added

    Players are...fixed? They are improved. Creatures have been added in. Tracking will be soon.

    ctrl+mouse movement now fills in squares. also, ctrl+shift+mouse movement works the same way.

    mouseListener moved to individual DisplayPanelCells, instead of the entire GridContainer
        -for users, this means clicking between boxes will not fill them in.

    fixed memory issues 
        -3 instances of ImageMenu now hold all terrain, object, and other sprites
            -on repaint(), each cell just takes those images, instead of storing the image in each instance

    New file can now handle maps greater than 30 by 30; above 500x500 not recommended; message adjusted
        -related: previously, rows were determined by column field, and vice versa. Fixed.

EDIT:
    Bugs: switches grid width with height (and vice-versa) upon loading a save.

v0.3
Features:
    First opens the FileDialog,
        -in the new File tab, can set number of rows and columns in a new file.
        -Problem is: takes a while to make bigger grids
        -no save still


v0.2
Features:
    -first time open now creates directories at %appdata%\DungeonDisplay for a windows machine.

    -players are now createable; only works with 80x80 gif; anything else could potentially behave badly
        -players can also be placed (albeit multiple times)

    -implemented SHIFT CLICK SUPPORT for placing rectangles of terrain & objects

    -scrollable window; NSEW buttons removed

    -classes separated into multiple files for better structure and organization

    -debug window now appends, but still not scrollable

Known bugs:
    -adding a player with the same name as an already existing player overwrites the image file (probably)



v0.1
Features:
-implemented editable interface on the DisplayPanel
    -fits to screen
    -Objects, effects, terrain editable and the former two are removable

-exit button functional
